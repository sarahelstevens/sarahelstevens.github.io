            <h1>Punters Betslip</h1>
            <p> In order to encourage users to stay on site, Punters developed the functionality to place bets with multiple bookmakers on both the Punters App and website. The Betslip needed to utilise a wide range of bookmaker assets to establish a sense of trust with the user, but also maintain visual consistency with the Punters brand. Additionally, the functionality of placing win, place and each way bets in available markets needed to be accounted for within the design.</p>

            <h3>Multiple connections from a single touch point</h3>
            <div class="left-column">
                <p>A consistent set of primary and secondary bookmaker colours were created and used as vibrant, full-colour backgrounds for the Betslip to make the user feel as though a secure connection was established with their chosen bookmaker.</p>
            </div><!--
           --><div class="right-column">
                <p>Custom keyboards were designed and developed, including the ability for users to select 'Bet to Win' amounts in line with traditional betting behaviours. The bet is re-communicated to the user before confirmation to ensure details are correct.</p>
            </div>
            <img class="content-image" src="images/Punters_Bet_Connect_01_2048x1600.png" alt="Punters iOS Bet Connect">
            
            <img class="content-image" src="images/Punters_Bet_Share_01_2048x1600.png" alt="Punters iOS Bet Share">
            <h2>Sharing a bet with your mates</h2>
            <p>Part of the long-term strategy for Punters was to leverage the existing community and socialise the betting experience. Punters has the unique advantage of an established community of vocal betting fans, that are each able to place a bet on any race with any bookmaker on site.<br><br>
            As a result of the Betslip improvements, there was a large increase in bets placed by our users and a dramatic uptake of users sharing their bets within the already active live blog. It is expected that these numbers will increase even more significantly with bet sharing included in the primary betting user flow.</p>
